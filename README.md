# John-Snows-Map
## Introduction
This project is a reanalysis and recreation of Dr. John Snow's famous cholera map from 1854. Dr. John Snow, a pioneering figure in epidemiology and public health, used spatial analysis and data visualization to identify the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London.
## Project Description
The main goal of this project is to reanalyze the historical dataset of cholera cases and deaths in Soho, London during the 1854 outbreak. By recreating the map of occurrences and clusters of cholera cases, we aim to verify Dr. John Snow's findings and understand the significance of his work in shaping modern epidemiology.
## Dependencies
The analysis is performed using Python programming language and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Bokeh, and Folium. 
## Results
The results of the spatial analysis and the recreated cholera map will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook or outputted as visualizations using Python libraries.
